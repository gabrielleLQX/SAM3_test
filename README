Steps to debug :

1. Open 3 terminals.

2. Go into the PATH the repertory of this programe

3. In first terminal, taping in "make monitor"

4. In second terminal, taping in "telnet localhost 5022"

5. In third terminal, taping in "arm-none-eabi-gdb main.elf -x BREAKINFO"

6. stay in the third one, and tape "c"(which means continue in GDB)


If you choose to transfer a frame : 

7. the first breakpoint is set for the configuration of variable SFD
(Start-of-Frame Delimiter) which should match the value of the register 
SFD_VALUE(0xA7)

8. the second breakpoint is set for the configuration of variable PHR
(PHY Header) whose least significant seven bits denote the frame length 
of the following PSDU(PHY Service Data Unit), while the most significant 
bit of that octet is reserved, and shall be set to zero for IEEE 802.15.4 
compliant frames.

9. the third breakpoint is set for an option if you want to enter the 
BUSY_TX state by rising the input pin "slp_tr", set it when the programe 
runs to this breakpoint.


If you choose to receive a frame :

7. follow the instruction printed in the second terminal.
